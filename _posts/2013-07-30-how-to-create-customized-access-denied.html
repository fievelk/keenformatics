Your new site finally needs the last thouch. <br />You're wasting your time walking back and forth in your room trying to think about what to do to improve it: suddenly, you remember that time when you first saw a customized landing page for that (otherwise) annoying <b>403 error</b>. <br />Now the question is: how the hell can I do that?<br /><br /><h4>And here's the answer!</h4>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">(Yes, that was an absolutely boring post introduction, but I'm not a writer. Not yet, at least.)</span><br />
<h1>The steps!</h1>
1) In <b>security-config.xml</b><br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint lang-scm">&lt;security:access-denied-handler error-page="/accessdenied"&gt;</pre><br />2) In <b>webmvc-config.xml</b><br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;mvc:view-controller path="/accessdenied" view-name="common.accessdenied"&gt;<br />&lt;/mvc:view-controller&gt;</pre><br />3) In <b>tiles-defs.xml</b> (your tiles definitions file) define the tile for your landing page<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint"><br />    &lt;definition extends="template" name="errors.denied"&gt;<br />        &lt;put-attribute name="content" value="/WEB-INF/views/denied.jsp"&gt;<br />    &lt;/put-attribute&gt;&lt;/definition&gt;<br /></pre><br />Obviously, change the paths consequently to your denied.jsp location. <br /><span style="font-size: large;">You're done!</span><br /><br />Now, you just have to customize the jsp in order to show the contents you want.
