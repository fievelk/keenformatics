excerpt: "The almost new Eclipse Kepler IDE has been released with a new exciting bug for those who use Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander).
If you're among those lucky developers, when you'll open your IDE you'll find that Eclipse upper menu is pretty useless, since clicking on menu entries nothing will happen: no submenus will show up as you expected.
So, what to do if Eclipse menu doesn't show up in Ubuntu 13.10? The best solution at the moment (until someone decides to fix this bug) is the following."
