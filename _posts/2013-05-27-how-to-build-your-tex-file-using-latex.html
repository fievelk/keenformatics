It comes with a lot of interesting functions, and it can easily be enriched with plugins using its awesome Package Control function.<br /><br />While I was writing my thesis about Kurt GÃ¶del I discovered LaTeX, an incredible markup language which I felt in love with; it passed just a short time before I desired to use it with Sublime Text, but when I installed the LatexTools package via Package Control I had to face a little problem in order to make it work.<br /><br>First of all: I think you already installed TexLive (a LaTeX distribution with many LaTeX tools) but if you did not, you can do so by typing this in your terminal:<br /><br /><span style="background-color: yellow;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sudo apt-get install texlive</span></span><br /><br />Now you can try (as I did) to build your .tex file in Sublime Text by pressing <b>Ctrl+B</b>. Unfortunately, all I got at this point was this error message:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">COULD NOT COMPILE!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Attempted command:latexmk  -cd -e $pdflatex = 'pdflatex %O -interaction=nonstopmode -synctex=1 %S'  -f -pdf &lt;your-tex-file-path&gt;</span></blockquote><br /><br />Read carefully these lines: what Sublime Text is trying to tell you is that it needs the <b>latexmk</b> package to build your file, and you didn't previously install it.<br />If you're encountering the same problem, the solution is trivial: you just have to install the latexmk package. Write this you your terminal:<br /><span style="background-color: yellow;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sudo apt-get install latexmk</span></span><br /><br />Now try again: you'll find that Sublime is now correctly building your tex file.
