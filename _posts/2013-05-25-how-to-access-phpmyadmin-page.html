Here's the case: you installed <b>Xampp</b> (or Lampp, as it was called until some months ago), you made it run, but now you can't access your <i>phpMyAdmin</i> page because you get this error message:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">New Xampp Security concept</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Access to the requested object is only available from the local network.<br />This setting can be configured in the file "httpd-xampp.conf".</span></blockquote><br />So, as the message says, let's open the file:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: yellow;">/opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf</span></blockquote>(its path may vary depending on your system and installation).<br /><br />Now edit the lines under this comment:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"># since XAMPP 1.4.3 </span></blockquote>So that they look like these:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"># since XAMPP 1.4.3 <br />&lt;Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin"&gt;<br />AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit<br />Order allow,deny<br />Require all granted<br />Allow from all<br />&lt;/Directory&gt;</span></blockquote>Now restart your Xampp and you're done!
