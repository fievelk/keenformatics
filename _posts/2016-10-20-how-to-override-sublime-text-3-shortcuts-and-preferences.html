excerpt: "I recently began using a Sublime Text 3 package that automatically generates inline YARD documentation for my Ruby code (Yardgen). The only problem with this package is that the key bindings it provides are overriding other Sublime Text shortcuts that I want to keep.
Since this plugin is packed in a zip file, it is not possible to simply edit one of its keymap files (see Package Control - Customizing Packages). At the same time, unpacking the original zipped file and creating a new zip file would not work.
Following are the steps that you need in order to solve this problem and, more generally, to override Sublime Text 3 packed packages preferences."

Key bindings for Linux are usually stored in the <code>Default (Linux).sublime-keymap</code> file within the Yardgen package archive. This is the file content:</p><pre><code>[<br />  { &quot;keys&quot;: [&quot;ctrl+enter&quot;], &quot;command&quot;: &quot;yard_gen&quot;},<br />]<br /></code></pre><p>We now have to create a folder named <code>Yardgen</code> inside <code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages</code>. We can then place inside it our new key bindings file that will override the default package behaviour:</p><pre><code>cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages<br />mkdir Yardgen<br />gedit &quot;Default (Linux).sublime-keymap&quot;<br /></code></pre><p>Now copy the following json content in <code>Default (Linux).sublime-keymap</code>:</p><pre><code>[<br />  { &quot;keys&quot;: [&quot;ctrl+alt+shift+enter&quot;], &quot;command&quot;: &quot;yard_gen&quot;},<br />]<br /></code></pre><p>As you can see, we just associated the <code>yard_gen</code> command to a different key sequence. You can obviously choose the one that best suits your needs.</p><p>At the moment, the <code>yard_gen</code> command is binded to two different key sequences: the default one, still present in the original package, and the new one we just defined. In my case, Iâ€™m not ok with this. Yardgen key bindings have in fact overridden the default <code>CTRL + Enter</code> behaviour, and I want to have it back.</p><p>If you too want to restore the default binding, you just need to figure out which command it was originally associated with and then explicitly add its binding to the Key Bindings preference file.
