<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1HrkYf0OYTI/Uff78zrOpRI/AAAAAAAAANc/8Fz_jV2UQsM/s1600/jsondate.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1HrkYf0OYTI/Uff78zrOpRI/AAAAAAAAANc/8Fz_jV2UQsM/s200/jsondate.png" /></a></div><br />After I managed to fix the <b>Datatables</b> jQuery plugin, finally squeezing my "Movie" class into the awesome table I prepared in my jsp, I found out that the dates in the columns were absolutely unintelligible: they were not properly formatted, and so they were showing up as a Long useless number. <br />My DataTables implementation uses <b>Json</b> to call the informations with which I'll fill the table's columns and rows. So, what I needed was something like a "real-time date formatter" for Json, something that would have been able to pick up my Date object from the model, format it in a comprehensible string format, and pass it to my DataTables plugin as Json. <br />If this is your situation at the moment, you'll probabily find this guide useful, since it's not very long and not very complicated. Well, it's not complicated at all, actually. <br /><br />I assume you've got a <b>jsp</b> (i.e. movielist.jsp), a <b>controller class</b> (i.e. MovieController.java) and a simple <b>java class</b> for the objects you want to manage in your Json call (e.g. Movie.java). Oh, you should also have enabled <b>Spring annotation based configuration</b> (see the reference links at the bottom of this post).  So... <br /><br /><h1>The steps!</h1><br /><b>1.</b> Create a <b>DateJsonSerializer</b> class that extends JsonSerializer. Like this: <br /><pre class="prettyprint">public class DateJsonSerializer extends JsonSerializer&lt;date&gt; {<br /> <br /> @Override<br /> public void serialize(Date value, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider provider) <br />   throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {<br />     DateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");<br />     jgen.writeString(formatter.format(value));<br /> }<br />}<br /></date></pre><br />As you can see, the serialize method sets up the format you want to use for your date strings.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> In <b>Movie.java</b> class, insert the @JsonSerialize annotation above the date getters:<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint">@JsonSerialize(using=DateJsonSerializer.class)<br />public Date getDate_in() {<br /> return date_in;<br />}<br />public void setDate_in(Date date_in) {<br /> this.date_in = date_in;<br />}<br /></pre><br />That's it. Yes, your work should already be done.<br />If you find something not working, please comment and I'll try to figure out a proper solution.<br /><br /><b>REFERENCE LINKS:</b><br /><a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/1.2.1/javadoc/org/codehaus/jackson/map/annotate/JsonSerialize.html" target="_blank">Spring docs - Annotation type JsonSerialize</a><br /><a href="http://sakaenakajima.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/spring-3-enable-annotation/" target="_blank">Sakae Nakajima - Spring 3 Enable Annotation based Configuration</a>
